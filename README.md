# U-Net Image Segmentation for Chest X-Ray Images

This project focuses on implementing a U-Net model for segmenting lung outlines in chest X-ray images. The primary goal is to accurately differentiate between normal and pneumonia cases using deep learning techniques. The dataset used includes images categorized into different classes, and the model has been optimized to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

## Features
- U-Net architecture for image segmentation
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU

I had the great opportunity to work alongside Rajesh (GitHub ID: [tripathy12345](https://github.com/tripathy12345)), whose guidance was invaluable throughout this project.

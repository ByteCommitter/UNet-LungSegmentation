# U-Net Image Segmentation for Chest X-Ray Images

I had the great opportunity to work under Rajesh sir (GitHub ID: [tripathy12345](https://github.com/tripathy12345)), whose guidance was invaluable throughout this project.

This project focuses on implementing a U-Net model for segmenting lung outlines in chest X-ray images.
## Features
- U-Net architecture for image segmentation
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU

# U-Net Image Segmentation for Chest X-Ray Images

I am currently having the wonderful opportunity to work under Rajesh sir (GitHub ID: [tripathy12345](https://github.com/tripathy12345)), on this project.

We are focusing on implementing a U-Net model for segmenting lung outlines in chest X-ray images.
## Features
- U-Net architecture for image segmentation
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU

## Outputs of segmenting the images:

## Model's Peformance Metrics:

Accuracy: 0.9806
Precision: 0.9708
Recall: 0.9538
F1-Score: 0.9623
IoU: 0.9273
Dice Coefficient: 0.9623
